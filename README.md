## TO-DO

- Make bars bigger
- Fix info in tooltip 
- On bar click, scroll to map
- Make front/landing page (Ballard)
- Make map section
- Link map and bar chart
- Brush map
- Make aesthetically pleasing


MINOR PROBLEMS
- Fix ticks on x axis
- Fix extra space on L and R in bar chart - DONE 
- Years (like 2016) cut off




## GOALS

# Bar Chart 1
- Make it look nicer
- IDEAL: Ballard's cool transition
- MVP: tooltip with year or just fix axis
    - make scalable, responsive, dynamic, blockchain
    - possible: grid lines?


# Chart 2 
- Grouped bar chart!
- x axis: june through november
- y axis: severity or max wind speed
- Hover over bar gives you name of hurricane
- Click sends you to the map

# Map
- Depicting 1 hurricane
- showing severity in each state by color
- include info about hurricane name and month, windspeed
- key
- not for MVP:
        - play through hurricanes
        - include arrow with direction

# Questions 
- What questions can people answer when using our viz? 
- Should I move to Louisiana or Florida if i am afraid of hurricanes? 
	- Want to see a viz that displays category and frequency of hurricanes
	- How frequently do hurricanes hit Florida? 
	- How severe are the hurricanes that hit Florida? 
	- How many have hit in the past one / five years? 
	- What are the least windy months  

- Were there a lot of hurricanes last year?
- 
hypothesis: there would be more and (they would be worse), turns out its not that 

# Summary of discussion 
- decided to go full map,
- look for FEMA spending data
- tell story of how we wanted to find how hurricanes have changed over time
	- How did we get here? 
	- We thought this, so check out this clean cut bar chart 
	- lets go to a map that filters data and is interactive in that sense 
		- all of the hurricanes that have happened and color is ordinal scale that is number of hurricanes that have happened in that state, frequency of hurricanes
		- filter of hurricanes that are of a certain category 
		- have a date range slider/filter function?


# Summary of discussion pt 2
- One map to rule them all 
- map will have aggregate data of total number of hurricanes that have hit each state, so each state will be colored based off of number of hurricanes that hit it 
- Tooltip will display exact number of hurricanes that hit it because all of the other states have been bucketed 
-we will have a filter section 
	- By year: have start yr and end yr 
	- by month: select / de-select certain months to display data 
	- reset/clear filter button 
	- *NOT FOR MVP* Deadliest hurricanes?? - if we're feelin real up to it we can have this filter option 
	- By category?

# Tasks: 
-Ballard: get pie chart working
-Maya: data manipulation/wrangling 
-Olivia: 
	-> DONE: make things happen on screen - filter btns, move sliders in right place-, 
	-> TODO: colors working -- maybe?
