        - play through hurricanes
        - include arrow with direction

# Questions 
- What questions can people answer when using our viz? 
- Should I move to Louisiana or Florida if i am afraid of hurricanes? 
	- Want to see a viz that displays category and frequency of hurricanes
	- How frequently do hurricanes hit Florida? 
	- How severe are the hurricanes that hit Florida? 
	- How many have hit in the past one / five years? 
	- What are the least windy months  
	
- Were there a lot of hurricanes last year?
- 
hypothesis: there would be more and (they would be worse), turns out its not that
